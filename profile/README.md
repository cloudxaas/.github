## Mission Statement

Our aim is to develop a reliable framework for programming for AI use, aspiring to reach a high standard in coding excellence and code security. We are aware of the significance of this endeavor for the aerospace industry and the global community, and we are dedicated to contributing effectively towards this goal.

In pursuing our mission, we invite skilled programmers to collaborate with us in shaping this framework. We acknowledge the challenges involved in this task, yet we are optimistic that with a dedicated team, we can positively impact the safety and security of our sector.

Our commitment is to ensure that each line of code in our framework adheres to stringent standards of quality, crafted with meticulous care and precision. We are conscious of the potential risks associated with any errors, which drives our dedication to achieve the highest levels of code security and robustness.

We are motivated by the belief that this mission is critical and cannot be overlooked. We feel a sense of duty to leverage our skills and resources to build a framework that safeguards our industry and the world. We encourage the world's most talented programmers to join us in this important mission, contributing their skills and knowledge towards a framework that will significantly enhance the safety and security of our field.

We invite you to join us at CloudXaaS, working collaboratively to create a robust framework for AI software programming and artificial intelligence, aspiring to set benchmarks in coding quality and security.

Our code repository is primarily focused on languages like Golang, C, Rust, C++, and JavaScript, but we are open to utilizing any programming language that is critical for AI software applications. We aim to achieve stringent standards, yet we are pragmatic in accepting effective solutions for the present.

The ultimate goal is to reach version 1.0, representing the highest grade of our development. Currently, we are working on version 0.0.1. Most of our work is initially developed in languages such as Golang, with plans to convert them to C or Rust in the future.
